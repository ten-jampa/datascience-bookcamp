# Data Science Bootcamp

This repository contains my work and exercises following the "Data Science Bookcamp" by Leonard Apeltsin. This project serves as a hands-on learning journey through various data science concepts and techniques.

## About the Book

"Data Science Bookcamp" by Leonard Apeltsin is a practical guide that teaches data science through real-world examples and hands-on exercises. The book covers fundamental concepts and advanced techniques in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to follow along with the book's chapters and exercises. Each section contains practical implementations of the concepts discussed in the book.

## Prerequisites

To work with this repository, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common data science libraries (requirements will be provided in each section)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/datascience-bookcamp.git
   cd datascience-bookcamp
   ```

2. Set up your Python environment (recommended to use a virtual environment)
3. Install required dependencies (specific requirements will be listed per chapter)

## Learning Path

This repository will cover various topics including:
- Data Analysis and Visualization
- Statistical Methods
