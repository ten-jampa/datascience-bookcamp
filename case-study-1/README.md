# Card Game Winning Strategy - Case Study 1

## Problem Statement

Would you like to win a bit of money? Let’s wager on a card game for minor stakes. In front of you is a shuffled deck of cards. All 52 cards lie face down—half red, half black. Cards are flipped over one by one. If the last card flipped is red, you win a dollar; otherwise, you lose a dollar.

**Twist:**  
You can ask to halt the game at any time. When you say “Halt,” the next card is flipped and the game ends. If that card is red, you win a dollar.

The game can be played repeatedly, with the deck reshuffled each time. After each round, winnings are exchanged.

## Objective

Determine the best strategy to maximize your chances of winning this card game.
